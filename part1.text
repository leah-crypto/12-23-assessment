I believe that doublerAppend is O(1) because it uses the push method.
I think that doublerInsert is O(n) since the unshift method was used. 
I think from my understanding that doublerAppend would be the function which 
scales better. This would be because O(n) is considered less efficent 
than O(1). Although both functions use loops different pre built
methods  can also have an affect on space/time complexity. 

I think that doublerInsert is slower because of its use of unshift,
aside from the different methods of push and unshift the functions 
look to be the same. As we learned this week, when unshift is used
all the current elements must be moved foward by on, verses push which
just adds an item to the end of the array.
